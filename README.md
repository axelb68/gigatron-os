# Gigatron OS playground

This project is intended for operating-system-like code supporting SD cards 
plugged the SPI ports of a Gigatron RAM & IO expansion board.
At the moment, there is a [readonly file browser and loader](sys1)
than can be executed when the Gigatron boots and allows you to 
run any GT1 file on the SD card.
